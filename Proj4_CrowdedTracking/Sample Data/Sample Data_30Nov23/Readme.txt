# These data are intended to provide higher spatial resolution for resolving/segmenting flagellar motion, and may be an improvement on the 10X -ph contrast images. 
# Image data collected on 30Nov23
# Mouse epididymal sperm; CD1 strain
# Imaging data: Zeiss AxiovertA1; 20X positive phase contrast; Axiocam 702 monochrome; 25C in 20um depth chamber slide
# Exposure: 1.00 ms
# Filenames: Microscope objective_Cell Density_Replicate #; Example 10X_HD_R1 is 10X objective, High Density, and replicate #1. 
# HD- high density: 12.7 million cells/mL
# MD- Medium density: 6.3 million cells/mL
# LD- Low Density: 3.1 million cells/mL
# Image size: 1024x1024
# Framerate = 149.7 frames/s
# Videos have 150 frames
# There are 10 replicates for every density condition. 30 videos total. 
# Note: Because these images are positive phase contrast, the cell will be dark on a lighter background. Images can be made similar to negative phase by LUT inversion.
